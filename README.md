# SentimentAnalysis-of-twitterdata-using-nltk

# Make sure you are running the code step by step as mentioned following otherwise your code wont work, Internet connection is required while running this project.

 # first create your own twitter id and create your twitter api at api.twitter.com and get your consumer key and access key.
 
 # In this project you can try my consumer and access key to run this project , I have provided those along with the code.
 
 # then go to twitter_credentials.py and enter your twitter api details and save the file.
 
 # Go to sentiment.py and run the file once.
 
 # Then run sentiment_mod1.py once and make sure it runs successfully.It may take some time.
 
 # Then we will create our sentiment analysis module which we will use to analyze twitter data using twitter api.
 
 # Run our very own sentiment analysis module sentiment_mod.py. This process will take some time according to your processor but dont worry you only have to run it once in your device.
 
 # Then we can analyze our twitter data using analysis.py and make sure you have your internet connection on, the program can be extremely slow/fast due to the reaction time of    twitter api and it also depends on the system processor and patience is the key.
 
 # We can also graphically represent our analysis using source code in graphical_analysis.py.
